# SigemerXR

## Project Description

SigemerXR is an Extended Reality app designed for prototyping emergency escape routes. It is aimed at security specialists who design and mandate the building of these routes.

## Features

- Placement, rotation, and scaling of a set selection of ad-hoc escape route 3D-models.
- Ability to save and load sessions.
- Ability to take and send a screenshot of placed models.

## Installation

1. Clone the project repository on your machine.
2. Add it as a valid Unity project on Unity Hub. The project was done on Unity 2022.3.34f1 with support for Android builds, you might want to use a similar version to avoid any compatibility issues.
3. This project was developed using Unity 2022.3.34f1. If you use a different version, compatibility issues might arise. These can be resolved, but it is not advised if an easy setup is desired.
4. The rest of the dependencies should be downloaded by Unity Package Manager.
5. Generate a running build from Unity build settings tab.
6. Download to an Android device that supports Google's ARCore. [List of supported devices](https://developers.google.com/ar/devices).
7. Execute, install ARCore, give permission for the app to use your camera, and you're ready.

## Usage

### 1. Planning Escape Routes in a New Metro Station

SigemerXR can be instrumental in planning escape routes for a new metro station. With such an environment’s complexity and high foot traffic, traditional prototyping methods could be time-consuming and costly. Using SigemerXR, planners can create and position digital 3D models of escape signs throughout the station. This allows rapid testing and iteration of various escape route configurations, ensuring that all areas of the station are covered effectively. The tool’s ability to visualize these routes in real time helps identify potential bottlenecks and optimize the placement of signs for maximum visibility and efficiency.

### 2. Updating Emergency Escape Protocols

Organizations often need to update their emergency escape protocols to comply with new safety regulations or improve existing plans. SigemerXR provides a flexible platform for quickly reevaluating and redesigning these protocols. Safety officers can use the tool to simulate different emergency scenarios and test new escape routes without the need for physical signs. This not only saves time and resources but also allows for comprehensive testing and refinement. The ability to easily modify and update digital models ensures that the most effective escape strategies are implemented, enhancing overall safety.

### 3. Polling Users to Improve Visibility of Emergency Signs

To ensure that emergency signs are placed effectively for maximum visibility, it is important to collect feedback from actual users. SigemerXR can facilitate this by allowing users to interact with digital prototypes of escape routes and signs. By conducting user polls and collecting data on the placement of signs that are most visible and intuitive, organizations can make informed decisions about their emergency signage. This user-centered approach ensures that escape routes are optimized based on real-world feedback, leading to improved safety and compliance with visibility standards.

## Configuration

The project should be ready to open in Unity as it is.

## Contributing

The project is being showcased for a short academic article, so the main purpose of this repo is not exactly receiving “open-source” contributions. However, if someone is interested in contributing, you can contact me by starting an issue on the project.

## License

The license will be defined once the professor guiding the writing of the article decides. It will likely be an MIT license or something similar.
